For this project in CSCI 4521, I explored machine learning techniques such as KNN, K-Means clustering, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using text data. I worked with the sms_spam_cleaned.csv dataset, which contains SMS messages labeled as spam or ham (legitimate messages). This dataset, originally from the UCI Data Repository, includes spam messages collected from the Grumbletext website and ham messages sourced from the NUS SMS Corpus (NSC). The dataset consists of two key features: Type, which indicates whether a message is spam or ham, and Msg, which contains the actual text of the message.

I divided my approach into five main components. First, in Binary Clustering, I applied an unsupervised method to cluster the messages into two groups and evaluated the effectiveness of these clusters in identifying spam, measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Next, in Clustering Quality, I used K-means clustering to further analyze the dataset, identifying clusters that were predominantly spam or ham. I generated word clouds to visualize key words in each cluster and examined misclassified messages to understand why they were grouped incorrectly. To test the robustness of my clustering, I created and classified new SMS messages, verifying that they aligned with the expected clusters. For an extra challenge, I customized the word clouds by modifying colors, shapes, and resolution.

Moving on to PCA, I conducted a Principal Component Analysis to reduce dimensionality and visualized the results using an interactive 3D scatter plot in Plotly. I identified outlier spam messages and analyzed why they deviated from the main spam distribution. I also determined how many principal components were necessary to explain at least 50% of the dataset's variance.

In Dimensionality Reduction and Classification, I implemented two versions of a 1-Nearest Neighbor classifierâ€”one using the full vectorized feature set and another using PCA-reduced features. I compared their performance in terms of runtime, accuracy, and F1-score while ensuring that data leakage between training and testing sets was avoided.

Finally, in Spam Classification, I designed a classifier to predict whether an SMS message was spam, justifying my choice of vectorization techniques (TF-IDF, stemming, or dimensionality reduction). I evaluated its performance using a train-test split and supported my design decisions with graphical and numerical analysis.

To present my results, I prepared a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with clearly marked and well-explained responses. Alternatively, I could have submitted a PDF report summarizing my findings with all necessary figures and explanations. My evaluation was based on the correct application of unsupervised learning, the clarity and accuracy of my clustering analysis, the proper execution of PCA and classification models, and the justification of my design decisions.

This project was a valuable opportunity to apply machine learning concepts to real-world spam detection. It helped me gain hands-on experience in clustering, dimensionality reduction, and classification, while also deepening my understanding of the challenges involved in processing and analyzing text data.
